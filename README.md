# Comp 426 Application


Our application predominantly seeks to serve those food insecure students by providing them with customized recipes based off of the ingredients they have on hand. In addition to those recipes, we will also provide students with a list of nearby resources (such as Carolina Cupboard, a food pantry on campus, and Edible Campus, a community garden initiative).

The application uses React as the Frontend, Express as the server, and MongoDB as the database. The frontend and express server are both deployed on Heroku.
