Our application predominantly seeks to serve those food insecure students by providing them with customized recipes based off of the ingredients they have on hand. In addition to those recipes, we will also provide students with a list of nearby resources (such as Carolina Cupboard, a food pantry on campus, and Edible Campus, a community garden initiative).

We plan on using React as our front end framework, with express as our server, and MongoDB as our database. We plan to deploy on Heroku.
